"Senior Fullstack Engineer, Accountants Assistant System Development (Tokyo)","About the position As a senior fullstack engineer, you will be responsible for leading the development of an accountants assistant system called “Money Forward Cloud Partner (hereinafter referred to as Cloud Partner)'', which is used by the certified business partners of Money Forward. Cloud Partner enables our business partners to efficiently manage their client information and provide various professional services.   You are expected to become the driving force of the development and also establish a great product team together. About team Business Platform Development Department, Cloud Partner Group You will be assigned to the Business Platform Development Department of Money Forward Business Company, responsible for overseeing the Business Domains that support the Money Forward Group. The Business Platform Development Department was established to maximize the value of 'Money Forward Cloud,' which supports the efficiency and management improvement of Japanese back-office operations. We undertake development related to cross-cutting concerns of Money Forward Cloud, working across multiple teams to develop services that are not limited to specific services but are utilized across the board. Additionally, we engage in project-based technical debt reduction activities We are currently seeking a development engineer for 'Cloud Partner,' a product exclusively designed for professionals (accounting firms and labor and social security attorney offices) available to certified members of Money Forward Cloud. Responsibilities The Cloud Partner Group sets forth the product vision of ""advancing the advisory experience for professionals."" Professionals play a significant role in the growth of small and medium-sized businesses. However, they often dedicate a considerable amount of time to paper-based management tasks such as receipt management and various application form preparations, which hinders their ability to allocate resources adequately to advisory services for growth support. Therefore, since our inception, we have been partnering with professionals and focusing on promoting the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through our back-office SaaS series, Money Forward Cloud. By 2023, our cloud accounting service became the No.1 choice among accounting firms, capturing a market share of 45%. Currently, we provide features that support the management of clients who utilize the Money Forward Cloud series. However, going forward, our aim is to provide new value that enables professionals to focus more on supporting the business growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We currently adopt Scrum development and do not divide teams or tasks between backend and frontend. However, considering the current balance of the team, we aim to strengthen recruitment efforts for engineers with expertise in backend development. Additionally, Money Forward aims to fully transition to English for development from the fiscal year 2025, and the Cloud Partner team is already progressing towards globalization. Currently, the discovery phase, such as issue identification and requirement definition, is conducted by some members in Japanese, which is then translated into English. The delivery phase, including design, implementation, testing, and release, is entirely conducted in English. It is anticipated that the discovery phase will also be conducted in English in the future. However, breaking away from Japanese in product and business domains is challenging, so a combination of Japanese and English will be necessary for the time being.  Technology Stack Backend: Ruby on Rails, GraphQL Frontend: React,js, Next.js, TypeScript Middlewares: MySQL, Kafka, Debezium Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform CI/CD: Circle CI, GitHub Action, Argo CD Monitoring: Datadog, Rollbar Task management: JIRA Communication: Slack, Zoom Requirements Must to have Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field. 5+ years of web application development experience Experience of react, Next.js and GraphQL Experience of frontend development with full stack web framework Experience of designing and deploying cloud infrastructure Minimum Professional working proficiency in English (IELTS Overall 6+, TOEFL iBT 60+, TOEIC 740+) Willing to learn Japanese Be able to relocate to Japan and commute to the office in Tokyo at least twice a week Nice to have Conversational level of Japanese Experience of backend development with Ruby on Rails and RDBMS Experience of system architecture design Experience of microservice development Experience of working in Scrum team Experience of practicing DevOps Experience of container based development Proficiency of test driven development Salary 6.4-11 million JPY annually Location Location: Tokyo, Japan.

Senior Backend Engineer (ID infrastructure) at Money Forward business company (Tokyo),"Overview Money Forward aims to move people’s lives forward by offering various SaaS applications for Back-office operations and eliminating non-essential work from complex daily tasks, and radically changing the quality of and time spent on work. In the Money Forward business company for which we are currently recruiting, we operate the Money Forward Cloud,  a SaaS offering for corporate back-office operations, which constitutes over 60% of the Money Forward Group's revenue. Through the integration of various back-office data and automation of tasks, we streamline and optimize the complexities of financial, accounting, and human resources operations. We currently offer more than 20 services as part of our portfolio. Why we are looking for Senior Backend Engineer(ID infrastructure)？ At Money Forward Cloud, which currently operates over 20 services, we are seeking individuals who can lead in addressing the growing non-functional requirements for business common infrastructure and microservices. Responsibilities We are looking for a Development Engineer for the 'Business Operator & User Management Service (Management Console)' – a critical infrastructure service that forms the core of 'Money Forward Cloud.' The Management Console serves as a fundamental service utilized by all B2B services, and it is committed to the mission of providing 'efficient, secure, and reassuring business operator & user management functionality.' This service offers features for user management among clients using the Money Forward Cloud series, closely integrating with the company-wide ID infrastructure. Additionally, it provides enterprise-level ID capabilities such as SAML authentication SSO and SCIM. Current Challenges and Future Initiatives Money Forward has been providing value to numerous small and medium-sized enterprises through accountants and tax professionals. In the future, to further expand our reach and provide our value to a broader user base, we require feature development targeting mid-sized and large enterprises. For large-scale businesses, the efficient execution of user management tasks and the assurance of high security are fundamental prerequisites for using our services. Looking at it from a different perspective, breaking down the business operator and user management functions from a massive monolithic application into microservices is also a significant mission for the ID Infrastructure Group. The primary data handled by the Management Console is stored in a growing common database alongside Money Forward's growth. While some data has already been moved to a dedicated database for the Management Console, a significant portion has not. Completing the microservices decomposition and aiming for substantial improvements in both performance and maintainability is our goal. Reference stop of the common database Our product not only accesses our own database but also references the shared database utilized across the entire organization. Discontinuing this reference is expected to enhance performance and availability. Various considerations, such as seamless data migration and transitioning the referenced database without interruption, need to be addressed to ensure consistency. Improvement of scalability Our product exposes internal APIs that are accessed by over 20 Money Forward cloud products. The number of calling products and user counts is expected to continue increasing. In such circumstances, it is imperative to design and continually enhance an architecture that can scale seamlessly. The development of GraphQL APIs in conjunction with frontend separation Our product's frontend was originally built with Rails. Currently, we are gradually transitioning the frontend to Next.js. We have adopted GraphQL as the API protocol for the backend. To continually meet user needs, it's imperative to design a resilient API that can accommodate changes. The Attractiveness of the Position With API access from over 20 'Money Forward Cloud' services (with over 200,000 paying users), there is a need to maintain high levels of availability and performance. Given the expected rapid increase in request volume in the future, there are challenges such as scaling out, load balancing, and performance optimization. This service is essential not only for end-users but also for the in-house sales and success roles that manage sales. It's a position that can contribute to streamlining internal processes. Every six months, we run the open application system 'MF Challenge System' for internal transfers. It allows applications across departments and positions, providing an opportunity to challenge a new career with a sense similar to internal job transitions.

Senior Backend Engineer (Cloud Box) at Money Forward business company (Tokyo),"Overview Assigned Team: Cloud Box development team This is the team that develops and maintains Money Forward Cloud Box, a storage service for managing documents like invoices and receipts. Mission： Cloud Box is a cloud file storage for back-office use. It makes it easy for anyone to save documents like invoices and receipts as digital data, following legal requirements. It also uses OCR technology to automatically recognize details like transaction partners and amounts from uploaded files. Our mission is to digitize and greatly improve the efficiency of back-office tasks. In recent years, many laws promoting the digitalization of documents like invoices and receipts have been amended. For example, after the amendment of the Electronic Record Retention Law, it's now possible to store these documents in Cloud Box and legally dispose of the original paper copies, which had to be stored for seven years before. This eliminates the need for businesses with many transactions to rent storage spaces for these documents. It also removes the hassle of manually writing titles on receipts and submitting them to accounting. Cloud Box plans to develop many features to maximize the use of these legal changes and not just comply with legal requirements, but also to use technology for more efficient operations. These include efficiently collecting document data from emails, websites, and even postal mail, analyzing uploaded documents for type and amount, smoothly linking data for expense reports and accounting, and implementing user interfaces for easy management of analyzed document data. Cloud Box also acts as a microservice. It provides APIs to other Money Forward Cloud products like Cloud Accounting and Cloud Invoicing, enabling them to store and analyze documents. With the increasing digitalization of documents, the use of these APIs is rapidly growing. Developing high-performance and scalable APIs is a major development topic for the future. In Cloud Box, we form small teams consisting of product managers, engineers, and designers for product development. Engineers and designers, not just product managers, are encouraged and expected to actively contribute ideas for making specifications. We are looking for team members who will join us in using technology to its fullest to digitize back-office tasks and achieve overwhelming efficiency. (Note: Electronic transaction data storage obligation started in January 2023, invoice system started in October 2023, etc.) We are looking forward to hearing from you if you are interested in working with us to take this big challenge.
